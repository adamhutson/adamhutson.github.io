<p>It seems to me lately that I am continually writing, essentially, the same program for every problem.
The language has changed from VB6 to VB.NET to C#, but the pattern behind the design is the same.
It&#8217;s always a Winform front end, common logic/objects in a middle dll, and data access from another dll that usually hits stored procedures on a SQL Server.
Not that it&#8217;s a bad design, because it&#8217;s not.
But I&#8217;m just afraid that I&#8217;m not growing as a developer.
I even use the same old design of a common starting point that calls a logical UI object that controls the flow to the user and back down to the database.
I guess it&#8217;s considered a data centric design for n-tier architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point is that I need more depth and breadth in my solutions.
Sure I can be an expert in this one area, but how often is another area a better solution to the problem.
What do I do when a client-server WinForm isn&#8217;t the answer?
I should have a better understanding of the WebForm/Web application world and the design patterns they use.
The funny part is, I&#8217;ve had jobs where I&#8217;ve written to mobile devices and done middle/backend work on web apps; I&#8217;ve even done Javascript on an ASP.NET app.
I was doing my part in those development shops; Providing the needed code to get the job done.
I just never felt completely comfortable with anything but WinForms.
At least to the point where I would tackle one by myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So here&#8217;s a goal for myself: Explore more solutions than just WinForms.
My previous post on free iPhone development training should be a good starting point for completely thinking outside of the WinForm world.
I would ideally like to learn more about ASP.NET web apps and Silverlight.
Certainly the MVC design pattern deserves quite a bit of attention.
But I should also explore the new kid on the block in WinForms, WPF.
Anyway, it should be a fun journey and I&#8217;ll surely have grown in the process.
I&#8217;ll try to blog about what I&#8217;m doing to achieve this new goal.</p>
