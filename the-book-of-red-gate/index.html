<p>I’m a pretty big fan of RedGate.
I use a few of their products almost religiously.
Their SQL Compare product is probably the most used tool in my toolbox.
I follow their blogs &amp; evangelists, regularly consume their free eBooks, and generally admire the company as a whole.
Their “Ingeniously Simple” mantra is really what keeps me coming back.
I even started to apply for a job there once.
However, the small requirement to live in England killed it for me.
So it’s no surprise that I would read The Book of Red Gate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s not so much a book, as it’s a compilation of all things that RedGate represents and the day-to-day nuances that is RedGate.
It’s also the quickest 76 pages that I’ve ever read.
All in all, it’s a fun short book that is an insight to what goes on around the RedGate campus.</p>
