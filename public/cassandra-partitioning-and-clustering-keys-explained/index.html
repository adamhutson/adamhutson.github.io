<p>Primary and Clustering Keys should be one of the very first things you learn about when modeling Cassandra data.
Most people coming from a relational background automatically think, “Yeah, I know what a Primary Key is”, and gloss right over it.
Because of this, there always seems to be a lot of confusion around the topic of Primary Keys in Cassandra.
With this post, I will try to demystify the confusion.
I will cover what the different types of Primary Keys are, how they can be used, what their purpose is, and how they affect your queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this post, I will be using CrossFit gyms as my subject matter.
The cool thing about CrossFit gym names, in a database sense, is that they are completely unique.
No two gyms are allowed to have the same name.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_basics">The Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Primary Keys are defined when you create your table.
The most basic primary key is a single column.
A single column is great for when you know the value that you will be searching for.
The following table has a single column, gym_name, as the primary key:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms (
    gym_name text,
    city text,
    state_province text,
    country_code text,
    PRIMARY KEY (gym_name)
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single column Primary Key is also called a Partition Key.
When Cassandra is deciding where in the cluster to store this particular piece of data, it will hash the partition key.
The value of that hash dictates where the data will reside and which replicas will be responsible for it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_partition_key">Partition Key</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Partition Key is responsible for the distribution of data amongst the nodes.
Let’s look back to an earlier post on Cassandra Data Model Basics, in which I described a four node cluster, as shown below.
For simplicities’ sake, let’s assume hash values are between 0-100.
When we insert the first row into the crossfit_gyms table, the value of gym_name will be hashed.
Let’s also assume that the first record will have a hash of 34.
That will fall into the values that Node 2’s partition is assigned.
So the value of the Partition Key, 34, indicates the partition, 26-50, in the cluster/ring that the piece of data will be stored.
Makes sense, huh?</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_compound_keys">Compound Keys</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But wait, there’s more!
Primary keys can also be more than one column.
A multi-column primary key is called a Compound Key.
The following example is a similar same table as above but changes the primary keys so that you can search a little more widely.:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_location (
    country_code text,
    state_province text,
    city text,
    gym_name text,
    PRIMARY KEY (country_code, state_province, city, gym_name)
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This example has four columns in the Primary Key clause.
An interesting characteristic of Compound Keys is that only the first column is considered the Partition Key.
There rest of the columns in the Primary Key clause are Clustering Keys.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clustering_keys">Clustering Keys</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each additional column that is added to the Primary Key clause is called a Clustering Key.
A clustering key is responsible for sorting data within the partition.
In our example crossfit_gyms_by_location table, country_code is the partition key with state_province, city, &amp; gym_name acting as the clustering keys.
By default, the clustering key columns are sorted in ascending order.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_order_by">Order By</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if I wanted to change the default sort order from ascending to descending?
There is an additional WITH clause that you need to add to the CREATE TABLE to make this possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_location (
    country_code text,
    state_province text,
    city text,
    gym_name text,
    PRIMARY KEY (country_code, state_province, city, gym_name)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (state_province DESC, city ASC, gym_name ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we’ve changed the ordering of the Clustering Keys to sort state_province in descending order.
Note, I did need to specify that city and gym_name is still in ascending order, even though it’s the default sort order.
Did you notice that I did not specify what the sort is for country_code?
Since it’s the partition key, there is nothing to sort as hashed values won’t be close to each other in the cluster.</p>

<h2 id="_composite_key">Composite Key</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Composite Key is when you have a multi-column Partition Key.
The above example only used country_code for partitioning.
This means that all records with a country_code value of “USA” are in the same partition.
This can lead to wide-rows very quickly.
There are just over 7,000 CrossFit gyms in the US alone.
So by using that single column partition key, we have a row with over 7,000 combinations in that single partition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avoiding wide rows is the perfect reason to move to a Composite Key.
Let’s change the Partition Key to include the state_providence &amp; city columns.
We do this by nesting parenthesis around the columns that are to be a Composite Key, as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE crossfit_gyms_by_location (
    country_code text,
    state_province text,
    city text,
    gym_name text,
    PRIMARY KEY ((country_code, state_province, city), gym_name)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (gym_name ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this does is it changes the hash value from being calculated off of only country_code.
Now it will be calculated off of the combination of country_code, state_province, &amp; city.
Now we aren’t sorting on those included columns.
Each combination of the three columns have their own hash value and will be stored in completely different partition in the cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_when_to_use_different_key_types">Why &amp; When to Use Different Key Types</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve shown you four different ways to use keys in table creations.
But why would you want to use one over another?
It all depends on the queries that you need to accommodate.
With the topic of CrossFit gym locations, I can think of a couple different ways that I may want to search for a gym.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First example that comes to mind is, I know the name of the gym I’m needing more information on.
I want to select from a table where the name equals that known gym name.
This scenario would be ideal for a single column partition key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second example that comes to mind is, I’m traveling to a city and need to find a gym there to get my workout in at.
I want to select from a table where I can specify the country, state, &amp; city.
I would expect a list of all the available gyms.
This scenario is great for the Composite Key.
It allows me to filter on the three parts in the key and Cassandra can quickly locate the information that I’m searching for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third example that comes to mind is, I’ve done the previous example and there aren’t any gyms in my city I’m looking for, so I need to only search on country and state, or maybe just country.
This scenario is ideal for the wide row example where we have a single partition key, and a bunch of clustering keys for narrowing the results.
I can select from a table where I know the country or where I know the country &amp; state.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choosing keys for your Cassandra tables can be tricky, but I hope to have helped shine some light on the details behind the decision.
I covered what the different types of keys are, how they can be used, what their purpose is, and how they affect your queries.
The following is a quick recap on the subject:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primary Keys, also known as Partition Keys, are for locating your data to a partition in the cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compound Keys are for including other columns in the filter but not affecting the partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clustering Keys are for sorting your data on the partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Composite Keys are for including more columns in the calculation of the partition value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now go out and design some tables with different keys.
The best way to learn is trial and error.
