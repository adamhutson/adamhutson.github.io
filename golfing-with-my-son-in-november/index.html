<p>Yesterday, my 5-yr old son, Logan, and my step-father-in-law, Jerry, and I went to play golf &#8230;&#8203; in November!
Being in the hign-60&#8217;s, it was just TOO nice of a day to not take advantage of it.
Logan really has a  surprisingly good tee-shot.
He made it on the green with one tee-shot and chipped one in from 15-ft away in the rough!
Pretty stinking amazing for a kid that doesn&#8217;t get to play too much.
We were playing out at Rivercut.
I think it&#8217;s a well kept secret that Rivercut has a short 4-hole, chip-n-putt course next to the main 18-hole course.
Most golfers can see the short course from the 3rd hole on the main course, but don&#8217;t realize what it is.
All you need to play is a wedge and a putter, but having a lob-wedge will help the ball stop on the hard greens a little better.
Each of the holes are par 3 (I think) and about 50-75 yards in length.
The tee-box and green is turf, but the rest of the field is grass.
The best part is that it&#8217;s free!
It&#8217;s a fantastic place to practice and let kids learn.
Jerry and I were able to just watch Logan and help him with his mechanics.
We didn&#8217;t have anyone in front of or behind of us, so we played through a second round.
It was such a great experience.
We played a few balls at a time on each hole, so there was a lot of practice time.
Now Logan is ready to go back real soon.
So am I.</p>
