<p>The task of a data modeler is to create order out of chaos without excessively distorting the truth.
The finished product should be a data model that describes the structure, manipulation and integrity aspects of the data to be stored.
To properly create a data model, the modeler will transform said chaos through three distinct stages.
The first is a Conceptual Data Model, then a Logical Data Model, and lastly, a Physical Data Model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first two posts, Conceptual Data Model and Logical Data Model, in this series have been published.
This third post, the series finale, will be on the Physical data model.
It will build upon the information learned in the Conceptual and Logical Data Model posts.
Finally, it will  walk through the creation of a full blown physical data model for a service scheduling application to be built with a Cassandra backend.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_physical_data_model">Physical Data Model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Physical data models continue the momentum created during the design of the Conceptual and Logical data models.
The main objective is to apply the constraints of your chosen database management system.
The physical model will describe table structure using syntax which includes data types, keys, &amp; relationships.
This means that an accurate use of data type is needed for entity columns.
Typically, we also need to mind the use of reserved words to avoid them in naming entities and columns.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_diagramming_physical_data_models">Diagramming Physical Data Models</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To continue our simple example model around Person entities, we now need to determine what the data types will be for each of the columns.
The keys should use ‘uuid’ data types as they are globally unique to ensure there will never be conflicts.
Remember the data is completely distributed, so it prevents us from trying to use an auto-incrementing value.
The rest of the columns are rather normal from most any DBMS.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE person (
    person_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    age int,
    gender text,
    name text
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This simple table is a great start.
But we need to be able to show a person in relation to another person.
The Logical model has a many-to-many table for relations.
That works  great in relational databases as tables can be joined server-side.
However, joins are currently not supported in Cassandra.
So we will need to have query-based tables instead of entity-based.
We need to think how will the data be searched and shown in the application.
For this, we will combine our previously modeled, entity-based tables into query-centric tables.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE children_by_parent (
    parent_id uuid,
    child_id uuid,
    parent_name text,
    parent_age int,
    parent_gender text,
    child_name text,
    child_age int,
    child_gender text,
    PRIMARY KEY (parent_id, child_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (child_id ASC);</code></pre>

    PRIMARY KEY (child_id, parent_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (parent_id ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the above two tables, we can search by either the parent or child unique identifier.
Respectively we can retrieve either the associated children to that parent, or the parents to that child.
So we have taken the spirit of the Logical Data Model and applied the constraints of Cassandra to the achieve a Physical Data Model.</p>

<h2 id="_physical_data_model_for_cassandra">Physical Data Model for Cassandra</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we’ve established what the Physical data model is, let’s write one intended for Cassandra using our earlier modeled scheduling application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE client (
    client_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    gender text,
    name text,
    phone_number text
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This simple table is great if all I want to search by is the client’s unique identifier.
But how often is someone going to actually know that value.
Let’s create a couple similar tables that has the same information.
But now let’s allow us to search by a value that is readily known, phone number or name.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE client_by_phone_number (
    phone_number text,
    client_id uuid,
    name text,
    gender text,
    PRIMARY KEY (phone_number, client_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (client_id ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE client_by_name (
    name text,
    client_id uuid,
    phone_number text,
    gender text,
    PRIMARY KEY (name, client_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (client_id ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With either of these tables we can search by phone_number or name, respectively.
However, those values may not be completely unique.
There could be two clients that are using the same phone number (i.e. siblings with the same home phone).
There could be many clients with the same name.
We don’t want our data model to only allow a single row in these cases, so I added a compound primary key that also includes client_id.
The end result is that if you search and there are multiple values, then you will retrieve all the records with that value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Service Appointment</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE service_appointment (
    service_appointment_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    appointment_datetime timestamp,
    client_id uuid,
    service_id uuid,
    service_provider_employee_id uuid,
    service_provider_id uuid,
    service_stated_duration int
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we are again, with a table that has all of our data and does satisfy the Logical Data Model, but doesn’t make sense from a search perspective.
Remember, Cassandra can only search on the fields in the PRIMARY KEY.
So unless the person searching knows the unique identifier for the service appointment, they can’t do much with this table.
We need to structure this data around common search values, like possibly appointment time, or by the client’s phone number.
Those are likely to be needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE service_appointment_by_appointment_datetime (
    appointment_datetime timestamp,
    service_appointment_id uuid,
    service_stated_duration int,
    client_id uuid,
    service_id uuid,
    service_provider_employee_id uuid,
    service_provider_id uuid,
    PRIMARY KEY (appointment_datetime, service_appointment_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (service_appointment_id ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seems like a much better table.
However, having all of those unique identifiers for the client, service, employee, etc don’t really help us out.
With that structure, we’re going to have to take those values and re-query the database to retrieve that info.
Not good from a performance stand point.
No reason to make multiple round trips on the network to the database if we can prevent it.
Let’s add that information directly to this table.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE service_appointment_by_appointment_datetime (
    service_appointment_datetime timestamp,
    service_appointment_id uuid,
    service_appointment_stated_duration int,
    client_id uuid,
    client_name text,
    client_age int,
    client_gender text,
    client_phone_number text,
    service_id uuid,
    service_name text,
    service_suggested_duration int,
    service_type text,
    service_description text,
    service_provider_employee_id uuid,
    service_provider_employee_name text,
    service_provider_employee_working_hours text,
    service_provider_id uuid,
    service_provider_name text,
    service_provider_phone_number text,
    PRIMARY KEY (appointment_datetime, service_appointment_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (service_appointment_id ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice, we still have the basic query structure in place, we’ve just added more information to the row so that we have everything we need without searching more tables.
This is a common denormalization trick from data warehousing.
Let’s create a similar table that allows searching by the client’s phone number.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE service_appointment_by_client_phone_number (
    service_appointment_datetime timestamp,
    service_appointment_id uuid,
    service_appointment_stated_duration int,
    client_id uuid,
    client_name text,
    client_age int,
    client_gender text,
    client_phone_number text,
    service_id uuid,
    service_name text,
    service_suggested_duration int,
    service_type text,
    service_description text,
    service_provider_employee_id uuid,
    service_provider_employee_name text,
    service_provider_employee_working_hours text,
    service_provider_id uuid,
    service_provider_name text,
    service_provider_phone_number text,
    PRIMARY KEY (client_phone_number, appointment_datetime, service_appointment_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (appointment_datetime DESC, service_appointment_id ASC);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But wait, what is going on there with the ORDER BY statement?
This table will allow for all client’s appointments to be retrieved with their phone number.
In order to show all of the appointments in a logical manner, the ORDER BY has them listed in descending order, denoted by the DESC.
This will give us the latest appointment time for the client.
Also the service appointment unique identifier is included to guarantee uniqueness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Service Provider</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE service_provider (
    service_provider_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    phone_number text
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By now, you should be getting the hang of what I’m doing here.
Take the table that is defined in the Logical Data Model, and switching the columns around to satisfy different search paths.
Nothing really too exciting, just more use cases to search by.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">CREATE TABLE service_provider_by_name (

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Services &amp; Service Provider Employees</strong></p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This one is an interesting case, because these two tables have what’s called a many-to-many table in the relational world.
That means that there are many services that a service provider employee can perform and that a service may be performed by many service provider employees.
We have to be careful when implementing this into the physical data model, so that we don’t restrict this relationship.
This use case would need to be, “What employees can perform a particular service?” and “What services can a particular employee perform?”</p>

<p>In the other posts in this series, I’ve included a combined view of the post’s particular data model.
This post on the Physical data model is different though.
The final product of the Physical data model is just a script.
This script should be runnable on your targeted Cassandra platform.
I say targeted, because every version of Cassandra is slightly different, with features being added and deprecated.
Ideally, the script will be idempotent, meaning that you can run it multiple times without error and the output is the same as the first run.
The final product of this post is a single script, located here, for you to download, examine, run, and learn from.</p>

<p>This is the conclusion to my series on Data Modeling.
I’ve taken you through the three steps of constructing a proper data model.
You should understand the differences between the Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Data Models now.
Also, you should have a pretty good grasp on how to construct a solid Physical Data Model that is designed for Cassandra.
