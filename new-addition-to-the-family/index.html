<p>Itâ€™s been entirely too long since my last post.
The last time I posted I had just started my new job and was blogging about the experience and silly setup reminders for myself.
Itâ€™s been about 9 months and I am still loving Expedia!
I have a great management team supporting me.
And they like to have fun; the company held an off-site in Las Vegas, at the Palazzo for three days.
It really is the most challenging and rewarding position Iâ€™ve had in my career.
However, outside of work, Iâ€™ve had a lot going on, to say the least.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In January, we welcomed our 4th child into our family.
She has been keeping us all very busy.
Now that sheâ€™s 7 weeks old now, she is just starting to smile and coo a bit.
I just wanted to share a quick picture of one of those rare moments that her face just lit up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides the birth, we recently listed our home for sale.
Itâ€™s surprisingly difficult to fit a family of six into a three bedroom house.
Weâ€™ve also discovered that having four children causes you to outgrow vehicles as well.  ðŸ™‚
Guess Iâ€™ll be shopping for a large SUV soon (or maybe a short bus, HA).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If that wasnâ€™t enough, Iâ€™ve also been finishing up about a year long contract for some Business Intelligence software for a company in the SW US.
With an extra 15-20 hours / week, it will be a needed relief to have it finalized.
Itâ€™s a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) front end, C# middle, connecting to SQL Server database warehouse.
I have to say Iâ€™ve really enjoyed developing WPF over Windows Forms.
Working with XAML, the development cycle went very quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking to the future, I have to admit, Iâ€™ve already got my next project lined up.
Iâ€™m going online for this one and tackling the MVC pattern.
Stay tuned.
It should be a fun experience as Iâ€™m going to try to adopt the 37signals way of simple design.
Their REWORK book has been bouncing around my head for a while now and Iâ€™d like to start a new project with it in mind.</p>
