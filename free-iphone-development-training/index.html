<p>A few months ago, I was talking with a friend about programming on an iPhone.
We were discussing the potential audience that an iPhone commanded.
I didn&#8217;t know much how the iPhone operated (I don&#8217;t own one), however, it did pique my interest enough to research it a bit.
So, shortly after that conversation, I went to the Apple Dev Center and perused the Getting Started Documentation.
Well, it was more than a little confusing.
I&#8217;m a .NET developer and certainly didn&#8217;t have a grasp on the iPhone or it&#8217;s programming model.
Needless to say, I didn&#8217;t make it very far in reading that initial documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last night, I was surfing blogs and came across David Hayden&#8217;s blog.
He had an entry on iPhone development and again I was reminded that I didn&#8217;t really give it my all in getting under the hood of the iPhone.
David&#8217;s post pointed to free iPhone training by Stanford University on iTunes.
WHAT?!
FREE?!
So now I have downloaded the almost 24 hours of video and 17 PDFs.
This time I will give the iPhone the attention it deserves.
Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to put together a Hello World app on an iPhone.
(Anyone want to let me borrow a Mac OS X and iPhone?!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the following link to find the free training.
It should either open iTunes and allow you to download the videos/PDFs, or it&#8217;ll prompt you to install iTunes.</p>
