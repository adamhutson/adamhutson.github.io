<p>Today, I got to go play in the fall leaves with my family out at the Nature Center.
What a great day!
We are still having awesome weather and the leaves are perfect right now.
We even got to actually watch them fall from the trees.
The kids ate it up!
It was Suzanne&#8217;s idea to go take them out.
In the past years, we never needed to go somewhere to experience leaves.
In our old house, we could just look out the windows and see all of the 50-yr old trees in our neighborhood in full color.
But our new house is in an area of newer homes, so there&#8217;s not any established trees to enjoy.
That&#8217;s one of the main things that I really miss about the old house.
Oh well, my kids are still getting to experience the fantastic fall leaves of the Ozarks.
Thanks to my wife&#8217;s resourcefulness.</p>
