<p>This morning, when I came into work, I discovered that Windows Update had graciously restarted my machine for me.
No big deal.
But wait, then I realized I had some SQL work that I hadn&#8217;t saved yet.
NOOOOOO!!!
I know, I know, &#8230;&#8203; always save your work.
But yesterday, I didn&#8217;t.
So you can imagine how irritated I was to discover that all of that hard work was gone.
Or so I thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A co-worker heard me getting mad at myself and chimed in that SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has an autorecover feature.
WHAT!?
Yep, when ever you start typing a query in SSMS, a file is automatically created and saves itself every 5 minutes.
The location of this AutoRecover document is located in "\My Documents\SQL Server Management Studio\Backup Files\Solution [n]\".
The [n] represents an integer that corresponds to how many SSMS IDE windows you have open.
I only had one IDE open, with two query windows open, so I had a "\Solution 1\" folder with two files in it: <sub>AutoRecover.</sub>vs47E8.sql &amp; <sub>AutoRecover.</sub>vsD5FD.sql.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try it out.
Open the folder mentioned above and open a new SSMS IDE and Query window and start typing out a quick SELECT.
After about 5 minutes, you will see a new file prefixed with "<sub>AutoRecover.</sub>vsXXXX.sql".
The X&#8217;s are alphanumeric values that change with every file.
The new file will get auto saved in 5 min increments from there on.
When you close SSMS or a query window and it asks you if you want to save, click No, and watch the auto-generated file delete itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wow, that was a HUGE relief.
SSMS 2005 and higher has this feature built in.
Thank you Microsoft for saving me from my own carelessness.</p>
